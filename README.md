# Telco-Customer-Churn-Prediction-Model
In this project, I developed a predictive model for customer churn using a random forest classifier. The dataset contained customer demographic and behavioral data, and I preprocessed the data by encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding and scaling numeric variables. After splitting the data into training and testing sets, I trained the random forest classifier on the training data and evaluated its performance on the testing data. The model achieved a high accuracy score of 0.995 and performed well in predicting both positive and negative churn.

By completing this project, I demonstrated proficiency in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning model development and evaluation.
